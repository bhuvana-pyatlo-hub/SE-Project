**Project Title**

AI-Powered Test Automation: Leveraging LLM Chaining for Efficient Test Case Generation

**Overview**

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the generation of JUnit test cases for Java programs. 
By leveraging LLM chaining—specifically combining Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet—the system iteratively refines test cases to achieve high code coverage and correctness. 
The project demonstrates significant improvements over single-LLM approaches, achieving 99.05% branch coverage and 90.48% line coverage on the HumanEval dataset.


**Key Features**

Multi-LLM Pipeline: Uses Gemini for initial test case generation and GPT-4o/Claude-3.5 Sonnet for refinement.

High Code Coverage: Achieves near-complete branch and line coverage through iterative refinement.

Automated Analysis: Integrates JUnit for test execution and JaCoCo for coverage measurement.

Scalable: Designed to handle multiple Java classes and complex codebases.

**Prerequisites**:

Python 3.8 or higher

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher

JUnit 5 and JaCoCo for test execution and coverage analysis

API keys for Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet (replace placeholders in the scripts)


**Installation:**

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-test-automation.git

cd ai-test-automation

2.Install Python Dependencies

3.Set up Java environment:

  Ensure JDK is installed and JAVA_HOME is configured.

  Add JUnit 5 and JaCoCo to your project's build path (e.g., via Maven or Gradle).


** Usage**
  1.Single-LLM Test Generation
  
    Run the SingleLLM.py script to generate test cases using Gemini
  
  2.Multi-LLM Test Generation and Refinement
    
    Run the MultipleLLM.py script to generate and refine test cases using Gemini and GPT-4o

 ** Output**
   Generated test cases are saved in src/test/java/original/.

   Test execution and coverage reports are generated by JUnit and JaCoCo.
